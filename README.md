# PasswordChecker
This small project checks if an alphanumeric string meets the complexity conditions to be used as a password (it must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters; it must also be between 8 and 200 characters long) and verifies via K-anonymity with the https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3 API if it has ever been hacked.
